## Rationale

- Most customer relationship management (CRM) software is built for large businesses
- CRMs include dozens of features that freelancers and solo consultants do not need
- Excess features create a cluttered UI that leads to lower user adoption and satisfaction
- Sellwell provides just enough functionality to make the sales process easy and efficient for freelancers and solo consultants
- This is the CRM I wish I had when I was freelancing
